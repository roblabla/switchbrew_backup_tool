# Switchbrew Backup

A simple script that turns the switchbrew mediawiki into a git repository, so
that data is duplicated somewhere in case something happens to the wiki. It
creates a commit for every change in the wiki, with the author name and commit
date being equivalent to the change author name and date on wiki.

The "official" repository can be found at https://github.com/roblabla/switchbrew\_backup.
It is updated daily (assuming my cronjob didn't die or something).
